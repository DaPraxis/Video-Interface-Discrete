The long-term goal of our research is to identify what aspects of the driving task require focused attention and increase driver workload. You will first be asked to provide some background information that will help us interpret the results (your age, sex, years of driving experience, the frequency with which your drive, your self-rated driving skill, and the state or province that you live in).

The main part of the experiment will involve making judgments about the difficulty of driving situations (shown in videos or presented as a text description).  You will also be asked to play whack-a-mole games that are specially designed to measure response inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. Further information about these games can be found at https://intro.braintagger.com/. You should finish playing each game before continuing to the next part of the experiment, and you will be able to practice each game before actually playing it.

After completing the first whack-a-mole game you will then rate 8 driving situations. You will then play a second whack-a-mole game, followed by rating of 8 more driving situations. Finally, you will play the third whack-a-mole game followed by rating of 8 driving situations. When you rate the driving situations you will be sometimes see a video of the situation and sometimes see a storyboard that describes the situation. In addition to rating the amount of workload in a driving situation using a slider, you will also be asked to pick the most difficult parts of the driving situation from a list of options. When you make your judgment on the video you can play the 10-15 second video as many times as you want but you cannot go back to a previous video once it has been given a rating by you. You will see a total of 12 videos and 12 storyboards across the whole experiment.

At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to provide any feedback or thoughts that you have about the experiment. You can take breaks during the experiment but the total time for completing the experiment, including breaks, should take around 45 -50 minutes.

The data we collect will be anonymized and kept in a secure database. No personal or identifying information will be stored and only summaries of group data will be included in written reports or presentations based on this research. Any data or information received will be kept confidential. 

You will be given compensation for your participation by Prolific. You are free to withdraw or stop the experiment at any time.
