The long-term goal of our research is to identify what aspects of the driving task require focused attention and increase driver workload. You will first be asked to provide some background information that will help us interpret the results (your age, sex, years of driving experience, the frequency with which your drive, your self-rated driving skill, and the state or province that you live in).
 
The main part of the experiment will involve making judgments about the difficulty of driving situations (shown in videos or storyboard descriptions). You should finish rating each driving scenario before continuing to the next part of the experiment.
 
When you rate driving situations during the experiment, you will sometimes see a video of the situation, and sometimes you will see a storyboard (with text and pictures) that describes the situation. You will either see all the storyboard driving situations first, followed by all the video driving situations, or you will see the video driving situations first. For each driving situation shown to you, you are required to do three things: 1. Rate the amount of workload you think you would experience (from 0 to 100) in that driving situation using a slider; 2. Pick the most difficult features of the driving situation (that will tend to increase workload) from a list of options; 3. Give 10-point Likert scale ratings to three questions regarding your willingness to interact with your phone (in each of three different ways) in this situation. When you make your judgment on the video you can play the 10-15 second video as many times as you want but you cannot go back to a previous video once you have finished giving the ratings for that video. You will see a total of 12 videos and 12 storyboards across the whole experiment.
 
At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to provide any feedback or thoughts that you have about the experiment. You can take breaks during the experiment but the total time for completing the experiment, including breaks, should take around 30-45 minutes.
 
The data we collect will be anonymized and kept in a secure database. No personal or identifying information will be stored and only summaries of group data will be included in written reports or presentations based on this research. Any data or information received will be kept confidential.
 
You will be given compensation for your participation by Prolific. You are free to withdraw or stop the experiment at any time. Withdrawal from the study will comply with the rules implemented by Prolific.co.
