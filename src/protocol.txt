Dear Sir/Madam:
 
Thank you for your interest in this research project. This letter has been created to provide you with the information needed so that you may decide whether or not you would like to participate in this study. Participation is voluntary and you are free to withdraw or stop at any time. Other than in the case where withdrawal occurs prior to the commencement of the main experiment, withdrawal of consent will not affect your compensation for participation.
 
If at any point you feel as though any of the following details are unclear, or if you have any other questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact me using the contact information at the end of this letter. If you decide that you would like to participate, please tick the checkbox below to agree to the protocol and we will keep it in our database for your reference. If you do not wish to participate there is no need to participate. You can simply close the website page without being recorded.
 
The long-term goal of our research is to identify the mental workload demanding sources on-road and therefore forecast high driving workload events ahead of time. This study aims to understand what elements in the driving environments can contribute to a change in drivers' mental workload level and quantitatively define its impact.
 
The design of the experiment is as follows. All participants will participate in the experiment individually, one at a time: 

* First, each person will be asked to fill in their demographic information, such as their age group, gender, driving experiences and etc. 

* Next, there will be three research sessions, each containing one Braintagger game followed by 16 video/text descriptions (8 videos and 8 text descriptions) of driving scenarios. The participants are required to complete each session one by one. Inside each session, there will be interactive instruction pages explaining the Braintagger game, video/text controls, and rating process, also definitions of 'mental effort' and 'driving mental workload'. 

* After the participant fully understands the task, he/she will proceed to the first research session. On this page, one of the games TAG-ME Only, TAG-ME Again(Medium), or TAG-ME Switch will be displayed, which are designed to test participants' response inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility respectively. All three games are presented based on the mechanism of the famous Whac-A-Mole game, while adapted to serve human cognitive science testing purposes. Further information can be found on the website https://intro.braintagger.com/. Participants are required to finish playing before continuing to the next part of the experiment, while they have multiple chances to practice each game before each game starts.

* After completing the game, the application will take the participant to the video and text rating section. The sequence of video rating and text rating will show up alternatively in a total of 16 per research session. 

* On the video workload rating page, the participant will be provided one video at a time, each [10-15 seconds] long. After the video play, there will be a popup slider for the participant to rate the driving scenario's mental workload level presented in the video. Below the slider, there is a form of multiple checkboxes and text areas. The participant is required to identify the source of workload demanding elements in the video by ticking the checkbox in the form region (input in the text area if none of the options apply) to further support his/her rating scores. After the participant successfully inputs their rating scores and identifies workload demanding elements, a text description of another driving scenario will be displayed (described in the next paragraph). During the video rating task, the participant will be granted multiple chances to replay each video, but he/she cannot go back to previous videos once the rating is confirmed. There will be a total of [8] videos in each research session, and participants are expected to complete rating all videos during the experiment. 

* The text rating page works the same as the video rating page, except the participant is required to rate text descriptions rather than video contents.

* At the end of the experiment, after all videos and texts are rated by the participant, the participant will be asked to provide some feedback on the experiment. The participant will also have a chance to accept or reject the rating results. Accepted results will be sent to the database for further analysis and the participant will be compensated accordingly, while rejected data will be erased at once.

[Breaks are allowed] during the rating experiment so that no one becomes fatigued, but it is recommended to complete the experiment no later than [2 hours].

During the experiment, only your input data will be recorded, which includes your agreement with the study, demographic information, video rating values, and the decision to accept or withdraw your result at the end of the experiment. 
 
The data we collect will be anonymized and kept in a secure database. No personal or identifying information will be included in written reports or presentations, and your confidentiality and privacy will be respected at all times. Any data and information received will be kept confidential. Any study reports and presentations will have all personal identifiers removed. Data and participant information will be kept in my possession or stored in a locked office accessible only by me and the other investigators. Electronic information will be password protected.

The experiment should take between [1 and 1.5 hours] and will be held completely online. As compensation for participating in this study, you will be given compensation for your participation by the third-party partner Prolific. Everyone is free to withdraw or stop the experiment at any time without affecting baseline compensation.
